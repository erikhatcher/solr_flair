== About

== Script

rvm use 1.8.7
rails new solr_flair
cd solr_flair
# added to git repo - https://github.com/erikhatcher/solr_flair

Installed Blacklight - https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Quickstart
  * notes: using my Blacklight version, a clone of cbeer's "next" branch
    Gemfile: gem 'blacklight', :git => 'git@github.com:erikhatcher/blacklight.git', :branch => 'next' # **** double-check this is set in final version
    
    
== TODO

 * Pull in LucidWorks gem, create custom collection and data sources
 * Blacklight generator - catalog controller optional, or at least require name
 * refactor blacklight/catalog.rb - make it more generically named, parameterizable perhaps?
 * rails g blacklight jams in SolrMarc by default, please don't
